## Projects
### Dog Breed Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
#### Project Overview: Developed a machine learning model to classify dog breeds from images with high accuracy. The project involved data preprocessing, model building, and deployment.
  - Collected and preprocessed a dataset of dog images from various sources.
  - Built and fine-tuned a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance.
  - Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
  - Deployed the model using Flask for creating a user-friendly web application interface.

#### Technologies and Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Flask.

### Vehicle Detection Using OpenCV's Haar Casdcade
#### Project Overview: Developed a real-time car detection system using OpenCV and cascade classifiers. The project aimed to detect cars in images and video streams with high accuracy.
Key Responsibilities:

  - Gathered and labeled a dataset of car images for training the cascade classifier.
  - Created and trained the cascade classifier using OpenCV.
  - Implemented a real-time car detection system that processes video streams.
  - Optimized the detection algorithm to improve speed and accuracy.
  - Evaluated the system's performance using precision and recall metrics.

#### Technologies and Tools: Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascade Classifier, NumPy.
